# Takeaway Decider

## To Do

* Wiring up the deciding button to pick a takeaway place at random and display it in the selection text field
    * In the MainActivity file recreate the on click listener and random generator. You may watch the video to replicate this.
* Add an empty input field for writing the name of a takeaway place
* A button for adding a takeaway place, that does nothing yet
* Wiring up the adding button to add whatever is in the input field to the list, and then clear the input field immediately afterwards
* Add some app colours
    * In the res>values>colors file choose your own primary and accent colors.
* Add an image of a takeaway
    * an image that is representative of your apps topic, don’t worry for now if you don’t have all the resolution options (hdp, xxhadp etc.) and use it in place of where the dinner decider app was.
* Run on your own device and show off to your friends and family!

## Done

* A hard-coded takeaway place selection shown in the selection text field
* A button for deciding a takeaway place, that does nothing yet
* Display a random takeaway place on startup
